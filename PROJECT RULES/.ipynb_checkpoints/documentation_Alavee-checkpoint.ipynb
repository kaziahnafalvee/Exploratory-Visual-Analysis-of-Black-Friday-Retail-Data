    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Yes, a preliminary examination was conducted to assess data quality and ensure compatibility with the planned visualizations. The dataset was generally clean, but the following steps were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing values in `Product_Category_2` and `Product_Category_3` were observed and handled appropriately (ignored in visualizations that did not require them).\n",
    "- Columns were renamed and reformatted where necessary for clarity (e.g., converting categorical codes to readable labels).\n",
    "- Some new features were synthesized (e.g., Age groups) to support specific visual idioms like grouped heatmaps.\n",

    "### a. Success: How well did the project address its goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was moderately successful in achieving its three main goals, each of which was connected to a specific visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 1:** Identify top-performing customer segments  \n",
    "   Addressed through the **interactive heatmap**, which revealed city-age segment patterns. The visualization provided clarity, but its simplicity may have missed interactions with other variables like marital status or occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 2:** Understand popularity vs profitability of product categories  \n",
    "   Captured by the **bubble chart**, which was highly effective at visualizing multiple metrics simultaneously. However, limited labeling and category identifiers made it harder to interpret without supplemental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 3:** Reveal co-purchase relationships for bundling  \n",
    "   Explored with the **chord diagram**, which visualized connections well but posed usability challenges for viewers unfamiliar with network idioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall**, the visualizations were functionally correct and visually coherent. However, in terms of **client usability**, more context (e.g., axis guides, legends, and summary annotations) could improve communication, especially for non-technical users.\n",

    "### b. Methodology: Reflection on Munzner’s WHAT–WHY–HOW\n",
    "\n",
    "The Munzner methodology was a helpful framework for structuring design decisions, though its **rigor introduced both strengths and blind spots**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHAT: \n",
    "- Extremely useful during data cleaning and attribute classification.\n",
    "- It forced deliberate thinking about how each field (e.g., `Age`, `Product_Category_1`) was encoded and interpreted.\n",
    "- However, it did not account well for **data quality issues** — for example, multiple product categories per transaction required extra logic, not covered in WHAT analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHY: \n",
    "- The action/target taxonomy helped refine task design (e.g., “Compare vs Discover”), especially when justifying interactions like dropdowns.\n",
    "- It became challenging when one visualization attempted to address **multiple WHY tasks** — clarity sometimes suffered (e.g., the heatmap's triple metric switch felt over-ambitious).\n",
    "- Not all WHY categories felt natural to my dataset. “Present” and “Query” were clearly applicable, but \"Identify\" and \"Annotate\" weren’t as straightforward to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HOW: \n",
    "- Most valuable in **visual encoding decisions** — channel choice (position, color, text) directly improved the quality of each visualization.\n",
    "- Helped prevent common design mistakes (e.g., avoiding hue for ordered data).\n",
    "- One limitation: HOW does not always address **chart literacy**. For example, the chord diagram was a good idiomatic fit, but not easily readable by a general audience — a concern not addressed by Munzner’s framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "If repeating the project, I would still use Munzner’s model, but:\n",
    "- Place more emphasis on **audience literacy and interaction patterns**\n",
    "- Limit multi-target visualizations to reduce interpretative overload\n",
    "- Consider integrating **perceptual and UX heuristics** alongside HOW analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Improvements: What would I do differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data and Preprocessing:\n",
    "- **Normalize metrics** (e.g., per capita values or Z-scores) in visuals to adjust for volume effects\n",
    "- Derive and use **richer features** (e.g., recency/frequency metrics for users)\n",
    "- Integrate more product hierarchy data if available (subcategory or brand-level)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Design:\n",
    "- Add **labels and legends** more consistently (especially in the bubble chart)\n",
    "- Use **icons or tooltips** in the heatmap to guide interaction (many users may not understand the dropdown)\n",
    "- Simplify the chord diagram by clustering low-frequency nodes or using hover-on-demand instead of showing all links\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactivity and Usability:\n",
    "- Provide **narrative explanations** within each chart (e.g., top 3 takeaways auto-highlighted)\n",
    "- Include **filters or toggles** to reduce cognitive load (e.g., slider to hide categories with <50 users)\n",
    "- Add a **comparison dashboard** to allow side-by-side filtering of segments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully applied Munzner’s framework to a real dataset and produced three reasonably strong visualizations. However, the greatest area for growth lies in **usability and refinement** — not in the data logic or visual correctness, but in making sure **the right viewer sees the right story at the right time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design process was guided well by WHAT–WHY–HOW, but a future iteration should balance theory with **audience empathy**, **simplicity**, and **narrative focus** to ensure that insight doesn’t just exist — but is seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
