There’s also no indication of statistical significance or variance within segments — all data is treated equally visually.\n",

    "| **Ribbons**       | Show strength of links using area + color |\n",
    "| **Arcs**          | Maintain circular symmetry, maximize comparability |\n",
    "| **Color**         | Used `d3.schemeCategory10` for distinct visual identity |\n",
    "\n",
    "This visual idiom was chosen because **pairwise relationships** between product categories were a key interest for the client — **bar charts or treemaps** would not capture this well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. Design Inspiration and Additional Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "While chord diagrams are a known idiom in D3, this version includes several original and thoughtful enhancements:\n",
    "-  Custom **data pipeline** built using Python to extract co-purchase frequencies\n",
    "-  **Thresholding**: Only included links where `value > 10` to reduce noise\n",
    "-  Interactive dropdown to filter and highlight **focus category**\n",
    "-  Top 3 connections bolded with **stroke-width and color outline**\n",
    "-  Arc label placement tuned for readability\n",
    "\n",
    "The final design was inspired by academic visualizations of network flows but was built **from scratch** using raw CSV data and D3 v7.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. Originality and Author Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization demonstrates originality through:\n",
    "- Custom data processing (`generate_network_data.py`)\n",
    "- Filter interaction and top-3 highlighting authored in JavaScript\n",
    "- Precision placement of labels and interactive hover effects\n",
    "- Dynamic matrix generation from adjacency data\n",
    "\n",
    "both the data structure (`product_category_network.json`) and the full visual logic (`chords.html`) were designed from the ground up to fit the dataset and client question.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### g. Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Success Critique \n",
    "\n",
    "The chord diagram reveals complex **pairwise co-purchase relationships** in a compact and elegant format. The dropdown filter and top-3 link highlighting guide user attention effectively, and the tooltips help clarify data without overwhelming the view. However, the visualization has a **steep learning curve**. Users unfamiliar with chord diagrams may not intuitively grasp the meaning of arc angles or ribbon directions. Also, the layout becomes cluttered with many low-weight connections, especially without interactivity toggled on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it achieves the goal of **discovering bundling opportunities** and supports exploratory business insights. To enhance its usefulness, simplification (e.g., threshold slider) and a quick-start legend or onboarding tooltip would help with adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1)  Goal Alignment:\n",
    "- Directly addresses the client’s third question: **\"Which product categories are frequently bought together, and can this be used to inform bundling strategies?\"**\n",
    "- Supports pairwise pattern discovery by visually highlighting **strong co-purchase links**\n",
    "- Enables the client to **query**, **compare**, and **analyze** relationships between categories to uncover bundling opportunities\n",
    "- Aligns with WHY actions: **Discover**, **Compare**, **Query**, and **Present**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2)  Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pros                                 | Cons                                       |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### (3)  Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "- Add **category descriptions** as tooltips (if available)\n",
    "- Integrate slider to change **minimum frequency threshold**\n",
    "- Export high-res PNG/SVG for report presentation\n",

    "\n",
    "While the chord idiom is well-established in D3, this version is **heavily customized** to fit the dataset and task:\n",

    "- All input data was manually generated in Python from `Product_Category_1/2/3` columns using co-purchase frequency logic\n",
    "- Includes a dropdown filter to focus on one category\n",

    "## 6. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Success: How well did the project address its goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was moderately successful in achieving its three main goals, each of which was connected to a specific visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 1:** Identify top-performing customer segments  \n",
    "   Addressed through the **interactive heatmap**, which revealed city-age segment patterns. The visualization provided clarity, but its simplicity may have missed interactions with other variables like marital status or occupation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 2:** Understand popularity vs profitability of product categories  \n",
    "   Captured by the **bubble chart**, which was highly effective at visualizing multiple metrics simultaneously. However, limited labeling and category identifiers made it harder to interpret without supplemental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal 3:** Reveal co-purchase relationships for bundling  \n",
    "   Explored with the **chord diagram**, which visualized connections well but posed usability challenges for viewers unfamiliar with network idioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall**, the visualizations were functionally correct and visually coherent. However, in terms of **client usability**, more context (e.g., axis guides, legends, and summary annotations) could improve communication, especially for non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Methodology: \n",
    "\n",
    "The Munzner methodology was a helpful framework for structuring design decisions, though its **rigor introduced both strengths and blind spots**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHAT: \n",
    "- Extremely useful during data cleaning and attribute classification.\n",
    "- It forced deliberate thinking about how each field (e.g., `Age`, `Product_Category_1`) was encoded and interpreted.\n",
    "- However, it did not account well for **data quality issues** — for example, multiple product categories per transaction required extra logic, not covered in WHAT analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHY: \n",
    "- The action/target taxonomy helped refine task design (e.g., “Compare vs Discover”), especially when justifying interactions like dropdowns.\n",
    "- It became challenging when one visualization attempted to address **multiple WHY tasks** — clarity sometimes suffered (e.g., the heatmap's triple metric switch felt over-ambitious).\n",
    "- Not all WHY categories felt natural to my dataset. “Present” and “Query” were clearly applicable, but \"Identify\" and \"Annotate\" weren’t as straightforward to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HOW: \n",
    "- Most valuable in **visual encoding decisions** — channel choice (position, color, text) directly improved the quality of each visualization.\n",
    "- Helped prevent common design mistakes (e.g., avoiding hue for ordered data).\n",
    "- One limitation: HOW does not always address **chart literacy**. For example, the chord diagram was a good idiomatic fit, but not easily readable by a general audience — a concern not addressed by Munzner’s framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "If repeating the project, I would still use Munzner’s model, but:\n",
    "- Place more emphasis on **audience literacy and interaction patterns**\n",
    "- Limit multi-target visualizations to reduce interpretative overload\n",
    "- Consider integrating **perceptual and UX heuristics** alongside HOW analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Improvements: What would I do differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data and Preprocessing:\n",
    "- **Normalize metrics** (e.g., per capita values or Z-scores) in visuals to adjust for volume effects\n",
    "- Derive and use **richer features** (e.g., recency/frequency metrics for users)\n",
    "- Integrate more product hierarchy data if available (subcategory or brand-level)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Design:\n",
    "- Add **labels and legends** more consistently (especially in the bubble chart)\n",
    "- Use **icons or tooltips** in the heatmap to guide interaction (many users may not understand the dropdown)\n",
    "- Simplify the chord diagram by clustering low-frequency nodes or using hover-on-demand instead of showing all links\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactivity and Usability:\n",
    "- Provide **narrative explanations** within each chart (e.g., top 3 takeaways auto-highlighted)\n",
    "- Include **filters or toggles** to reduce cognitive load (e.g., slider to hide categories with <50 users)\n",
    "- Add a **comparison dashboard** to allow side-by-side filtering of segments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully applied Munzner’s framework to a real dataset and produced three reasonably strong visualizations. However, the greatest area for growth lies in **usability and refinement** — not in the data logic or visual correctness, but in making sure **the right viewer sees the right story at the right time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design process was guided well by WHAT–WHY–HOW, but a future iteration should balance theory with **audience empathy**, **simplicity**, and **narrative focus** to ensure that insight doesn’t just exist but is seen as well.\n",

    "| **Confusing Goals & Redundant Visuals** | The client questions overlapped or weren't tightly scoped. Visual ideas like the Sankey seemed arbitrary or disconnected from real user behavior. | Reframed 3 questions into distinct business goals and matched each with a purposeful visual (heatmap, bubble chart, chord diagram). |\n",
    "| **Weak HOW Justification** | The proposal lacked detail on Munzner’s visual encodings and did not explain marks, channels, or idioms clearly. | Final project provides full WHAT–WHY–HOW breakdown for all visuals, justifying encoding and layout choices rigorously using Munzner’s principles. |\n",
    "| **Network Graph Issues** | The user-product network plan lacked structural clarity (e.g., mixed node types, insufficient connection logic). | Dropped weakly supported network graph; replaced with a valid category–category chord diagram based on co-occurrence — using clear, symmetric edges and frequency weighting. |\n",
    "| **Missing Pre-visual Analysis** | Proposal skipped over initial data analysis and lacked motivation for choosing visuals. | Final project includes EDA-driven metric definitions (e.g., avg purchase per user), shaping every visualization decision. |\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Data Made More Meaningful**  \n",
    "  I removed ideas that were too confusing or not useful (like showing raw user-product flows). Instead, I focused on meaningful calculations like average purchase per user and how many users bought each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualizations Redesigned Completely**  \n",
    "  - **Heatmap** = great for comparing different age groups and cities  \n",
    "  - **Bubble chart** = helps show spending amount, number of buyers, and product type all at once  \n",

    "  - What **channels** I used to show data (like size, color, or position)\n",
    "  - What kind of **layout or design style** I followed (e.g., grid, scatterplot, or circular network)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method and Interaction Added**  \n",
    "  I also added things like dropdown menus, mouse-hover tooltips, and automatic data generation — which made the project more interactive and technically solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Final Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The original project idea was not very clear and would not have worked well.\n",
    "\n",
    "But after refining the questions, choosing better data, and building three well-planned visualizations, the final result:\n",
