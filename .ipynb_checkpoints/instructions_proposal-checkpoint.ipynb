    "\n",
    "**Selection of the dataset** is on a competitive, first-come, basis, each student should have a different dataset to work with. Be the first to **claim your selection** at the [selection web site](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php) https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php\n",
    "* Approval of your selection will be based on the character of the data set\n",
    "* enough data points to provide interesting design tasks. Anything under 2000 data points would be considered too small. Smaller data sets with complex data items (such as geometries and/or links) may also be acceptable.\n",

    "**Work with a client** if you can. I have recruited a few faculty members who have data visualization problems to work on. I will post these as possible dataset choices. You may recruit your own *reliable* client (such as a faculty member) to work with.  I will provide an information sheet for them and some basic questions for you to ask before making final commitment to working with your client. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Work without a client** if you want. You must find your own dataset to work with and also act as the client by imagining appropriate goals and objectives. I will also post some suggestions for finding a dataset selection without a client.\n",

    "* Introduction to the dataset selection and the client\n",
    "* A preliminary analysis of the data set apply *what* methods\n",
    "* A minimum of three questions regarding the dataset, expressing your client's goals and objectives, suitable for a Munzner style *why* analysis.\n",
    "* Any initial ideas for visualizations, including visuals you do not currently know how to code (you can simply sketch your ideas). Do not limit your ideas to code solutions you are already familiar with.\n",

    "    * Submit at least three visual designs for feedback. They do not have to be coded.\n",

    "Optionally include any other preliminary ideas for other parts of the final submission. These will not be graded for marks, but you may get some good guidance and feedback."
