    "# Proposal Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project proposal, you must select a dataset for your final project and do an initial description of how you will address the dataset in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection of the dataset** is on a competitive, first-come, basis, each student should have a different dataset to work with. Be the first to **claim your selection** at the [selection web site](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php) https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php\n",
    "* Approval of your selection will be based on the character of the data set\n",
    "* enough data points to provide interesting design tasks. Anything under 2000 data points would be considered too small. Smaller data sets with complex data items (such as geometries and/or links) may also be acceptable.\n",
    "* different types of data and/or attributes\n",
    "* real world interesting subject matter (no fake or generated data sets)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Work with a client** if you can. I have recruited a few faculty members who have data visualization problems to work on. I will post these as possible dataset choices. You may recruit your own *reliable* client (such as a faculty member) to work with.  I will provide an information sheet for them and some basic questions for you to ask before making final commitment to working with your client. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Work without a client** if you want. You must find your own dataset to work with and also act as the client by imagining appropriate goals and objectives. I will also post some suggestions for finding a dataset selection without a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include these items in your proposal submission.\n",
    "* Introduction to the dataset selection and the client\n",
    "* A preliminary analysis of the data set apply *what* methods\n",
    "* A minimum of three questions regarding the dataset, expressing your client's goals and objectives, suitable for a Munzner style *why* analysis.\n",
    "* Any initial ideas for visualizations, including visuals you do not currently know how to code (you can simply sketch your ideas). Do not limit your ideas to code solutions you are already familiar with.\n",
    "    * Explain what each visual accomplishes in terms of the project goals\n",
    "    * Submit at least three visual designs for feedback. They do not have to be coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally include any other preliminary ideas for other parts of the final submission. These will not be graded for marks, but you may get some good guidance and feedback."

    "\n",
    "## **Dataset:**  \n",
    "[Black Friday Sale Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeshrampure/black-friday-sale)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction to the Dataset Selection and Client**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains transactional data from a Black Friday sale, including customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and other attributes related to consumer shopping behavior. The dataset provides insights into shopping trends, customer segmentation, and purchasing patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze consumer behavior during the Black Friday sale, identifying factors influencing high spending, customer demographics, and popular product categories. The analysis will focus on understanding key sales trends and customer purchasing patterns to help retailers optimize future sales strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Preliminary Analysis (What Methods)**  \n",

    "   - Cleaning and handling missing values, such as those in categorical fields like product category.  \n",
    "   - Standardizing data formats, especially for purchase amounts and categorical data like customer demographics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  \n",
    "   - Understanding **customer segmentation** by analyzing factors like age, gender, city category, and spending habits.  \n",
    "   - Identifying **top-selling product categories** and purchase distributions.  \n",
    "   - Examining **spending trends** across different demographics and locations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical & Trend Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Analyzing **spending trends** across different customer demographics (e.g., age group, city category, occupation).  \n",
    "   - Identifying **correlations** between customer attributes (age, gender, location) and spending behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Client’s Goals and Objectives (Munzner-Style Why Analysis)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The client (a retailer or market analyst) wants to understand **how customer demographics influence shopping behavior on Black Friday** and how they can optimize their marketing and sales strategies for future events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key questions driving the project are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which customer demographics (age, gender, city type) contribute the most to total sales?**  \n",
    "   - This will help businesses target the right audience for marketing campaigns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the most popular product categories, and how do they vary across different customer segments?**  \n",
    "   - This will provide insights into which product categories drive revenue and which customer groups prefer them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do spending patterns change based on city type and customer occupation?**  \n",
