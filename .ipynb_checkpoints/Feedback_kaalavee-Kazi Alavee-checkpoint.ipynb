    "\n",
    "For the project proposal, you must select a dataset for your final project and do an initial description of how you will address the dataset in your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection of the dataset** is on a competitive, first-come, basis, each student should have a different dataset to work with. Be the first to **claim your selection** at the [selection web site](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php) https://www.cs.mun.ca/~brown/6934/signupProject/projselect.php\n",
    "* Approval of your selection will be based on the character of the data set\n",
    "* enough data points to provide interesting design tasks. Anything under 2000 data points would be considered too small. Smaller data sets with complex data items (such as geometries and/or links) may also be acceptable.\n",
    "* different types of data and/or attributes\n",
    "* real world interesting subject matter (no fake or generated data sets)\n",

    "**Work with a client** if you can. I have recruited a few faculty members who have data visualization problems to work on. I will post these as possible dataset choices. You may recruit your own *reliable* client (such as a faculty member) to work with.  I will provide an information sheet for them and some basic questions for you to ask before making final commitment to working with your client. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Work without a client** if you want. You must find your own dataset to work with and also act as the client by imagining appropriate goals and objectives. I will also post some suggestions for finding a dataset selection without a client.\n",

    "[Black Friday Sale Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeshrampure/black-friday-sale)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction to the Dataset Selection and Client**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains transactional data from a Black Friday sale, including customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and other attributes related to consumer shopping behavior. The dataset provides insights into shopping trends, customer segmentation, and purchasing patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze consumer behavior during the Black Friday sale, identifying factors influencing high spending, customer demographics, and popular product categories. The analysis will focus on understanding key sales trends and customer purchasing patterns to help retailers optimize future sales strategies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>This is a training set for ML. Is it real or is it fabricated for a course or contest? There could be some question of how suitable it is for vis purposes.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Preliminary Analysis (What Methods)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing:**  \n",
    "   - Cleaning and handling missing values, such as those in categorical fields like product category.  \n",
    "   - Standardizing data formats, especially for purchase amounts and categorical data like customer demographics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  \n",
    "   - Understanding **customer segmentation** by analyzing factors like age, gender, city category, and spending habits.  \n",
    "   - Identifying **top-selling product categories** and purchase distributions.  \n",
    "   - Examining **spending trends** across different demographics and locations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical & Trend Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Analyzing **spending trends** across different customer demographics (e.g., age group, city category, occupation).  \n",
    "   - Identifying **correlations** between customer attributes (age, gender, location) and spending behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>These  valuable  steps, but I wanted a munzner style what analysis. A full munzner style analysis of any data column relevant is expected, which will lead to action/target pairs and channels and marks analysis in the how section.</mark>\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Clientâ€™s Goals and Objectives (Munzner-Style Why Analysis)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The client (a retailer or market analyst) wants to understand **how customer demographics influence shopping behavior on Black Friday** and how they can optimize their marketing and sales strategies for future events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>OK minimal for this assignment, but a full why analysis with action-target pairs is expected in the project.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key questions driving the project are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which customer demographics (age, gender, city type) contribute the most to total sales?**  \n",
    "   - This will help businesses target the right audience for marketing campaigns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What are the most popular product categories, and how do they vary across different customer segments?**  \n",
    "   - This will provide insights into which product categories drive revenue and which customer groups prefer them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do spending patterns change based on city type and customer occupation?**  \n",
    "   - This question will help businesses understand if urban or rural customers spend more and whether occupation plays a role in shopping behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Proposed Visualizations (How Methods & Design Motivation)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>in the project, you are expected to do a full HOW analysis incorporating marks, channels and idioms, and the methods of munzner's HOW. Make sure to leave design scope to allow this analysis to produce design ideas.</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactive Heatmap of Customer Spending by Demographics:**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** A heatmap showing how different demographic groups (age, gender, city category) contribute to total revenue.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** This will help retailers identify key customer segments contributing the most to sales.  \n",
    "   - **Design Motivation:** Heatmaps provide an intuitive way to visualize high-impact groups and compare spending behavior across different segments.  <mark>What about this is interactive?</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bar Chart with Customer Purchase Distribution by Product Category:**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** A bar chart displaying the top-selling product categories and how purchases are distributed across different customer segments.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** This will highlight which product categories drive the most revenue and how different customer groups prefer specific product types.  \n",
    "   - **Design Motivation:** Bar charts are effective in comparing different categories and identifying patterns in product demand.  <mark>But how will you show two set of categories? What is the design here?</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Animated Line Graph of Purchase Trends Over Time:**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** A time-series line graph showing purchase amounts over time, segmented by city category and age group.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** This visualization will help understand how purchase behavior fluctuates during the Black Friday event and across different regions.  \n",
    "   - **Design Motivation:** Line graphs are ideal for showing trends over time, and animation will help highlight purchasing spikes and trends dynamically. <mark?I don;t understand what aspect is animated</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sunburst Chart of Purchase Distribution by Product Category**\n",
    "    - **Description:**  A hierarchical sunburst chart showing how purchases are distributed across product categories, subcategories, and customer demographics.\n",
    "    - **Purpose:**  To provide a layered view of product demand and how different customer groups contribute to total revenue.<mark>How is the data sunburst? what levels?</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Design Motivation:**  Sunburst charts allow for an easy-to-understand breakdown of hierarchical data, making it clear how different segments contribute to overall sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Network Graph of Customer-Product Connections**\n",
    "     - **Description:**  A network graph representing the relationships between customer segments and product categories, showing how different customer demographics are linked to various product purchases.<mark>What is a node?What is a link? Where is the data for this?</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Purpose:**  To uncover patterns in customer-product relationships and identify which product categories appeal most to specific demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Design Motivation:**  Network graphs help visualize complex relationships, making it easier to see connections that might not be obvious in traditional charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>You state some chart types, but I don;t understand the designs wrt your data or what they will look like, so hard to assess</mark>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will provide an in-depth analysis of consumer purchasing behavior during Black Friday through interactive and animated visualizations. The heatmap will identify key customer segments, the bar chart will showcase popular product categories, and the animated line graph will reveal spending trends over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final analysis will evaluate how well these visualizations address the clientâ€™s objectives and suggest potential improvements, such as predictive modeling for future sales forecasts or refining demographic targeting for marketing campaigns.  \n",
