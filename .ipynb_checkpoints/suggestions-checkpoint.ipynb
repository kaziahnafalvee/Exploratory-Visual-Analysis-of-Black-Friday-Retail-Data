    "* **Client MK3** Contour platting for electron density maps\n",
    "* **Client HJC** creation of a digital elevation model from 3D photogrammetric model. This will involve software packages not covered this course, but I can give some pointers. Some extra challenges, but perfect for a student who already has some 3D rendering experience, perhaps in the games context. Or someone eager to learn 3D. The clinet is using Metashape Pro.\n",
    "* **Client CF** involves combining geophysical survey data with 3D computer models of the subsurface of the Earth. They want a fly-through effect, so this will also involve learning some 3D software packages.\n",
    "* **Client EJK** is a multiparameter set describing the amount of radiation used and the parameters selected for various anatomical radiology studies"
